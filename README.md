# CPA-Data-Analytics-Affordable-Housing-NL

## CPA Data Analytics Hackathon - Team 8 (HS3) - 3rd Place Winner

### Project Overview

This project addresses the significant gap in affordable housing projects in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), which has led to housing insecurity and homelessness. Our team analyzed the housing situation in NL and proposed recommendations to tackle this critical issue.

### Key Issues Identified

- Homelessness
- Inadequate Housing
- Unsuitable Housing
- Unaffordable Housing
- Vulnerable Populations Facing Housing Insecurity

### Analysis Highlights

- NL population: Approximately 0.5 million
- NL divided into 4 regions, comprising 372 subdivisions
- Housing insecurity rate: 7-8% across NL
- Low urban density compared to other regions
- Housing construction has slowed down since the 2000s
- Single detached housing dominates across all regions

### Recommendations

1. **Increase Social Housing**
   - Expand social housing stock from 3.1% to the recommended 7.5%
   - Implement public-nonprofit partnerships and mixed-income communities
   - Utilize municipal land for development

2. **Increase Urban Density with Apartments**
   - Promote compact, transit-oriented housing
   - Eliminate unit maximums and parking minimums
   - Adopt as-of-right density permissions near transit

3. **Establish Tiny Home Villages**
   - Address homelessness with affordable, supportive housing
   - Streamline zoning and permitting processes
   - Collaborate with local organizations for support services

### Implementation Timelines

Detailed timelines for each recommendation are provided in the 'Final Presentation.pdf'.

### Data Visualization

Our team created a Power BI report to visualize the housing data for NL. The PDF version of this report is available in this repository.

   - Transformed raw datasets into clean, structured CSV files optimized for visualization in Excel.
   - Evaluated and selected the most relevant datasets from the provided resources, ensuring our analysis was based on high-quality, pertinent data.

2. **Data Visualization**
   -  Created insightful visualizations using Excel to represent complex housing data in an easily understandable format.
   -  Extracted key information from PDF reports and transformed it into visual representations to support our findings and recommendations.

3. **Problem-Solving and Strategy Development**
  - Actively participated in brainstorming sessions to identify solutions for homelessness and housing insecurity in Newfoundland and Labrador.
  - Contributed to the development of our three main recommendations: increasing social housing, urban density, and establishing tiny home villages.
